## Text Visualization in Python with Scattertext
### Jason S. Kessler (CDK Global) | http://www.jasonkessler.com |  November 15, 2017

Two Python libraries I've developed, Scattertext and AgeFromName, are heavily used in the talk.

Please install them and if you have time, star them on Github:

- [Scattertext](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext)
- [AgeFromName](https://github.com/JasonKessler/agefromname)

The PowerPoint presentation is availabe in the repository as BigDataBellevueMeetup2017Kessler.pptx.

## Notebooks used in the talk:
- [Introduction to Scattertext](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/Scattertext-BBD2017/blob/master/Scattertext-Intro-Part-1.ipynb)
- [The truth behind fake news](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/Scattertext-BBD2017/blob/master/Fake-News-Analysis.ipynb)
- [Intersection of party and gender](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/Scattertext-BBD2017/blob/master/Scattertext-Intro-Part-2.ipynb)
- [Word representations and topical visualizations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JasonKessler/Scattertext-BBD2017/blob/master/Scattertext-Intro-Part-3.ipynb)


Software required to use the notebooks:

`$ pip install scattertext agefromname && python -m spacy.en.download`

It's news you can use: six Python 3.6 Jupyter notebooks showing how to visualize the following data:
